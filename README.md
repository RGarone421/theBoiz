you can post or buy someone elses listing.

JACOB:
WINS: Got everything I needed to work to work, postgres was still broken for me though but was able to help LUke with the backend through screen shares
Struggles: Working with 3 people can make merge conflicts a bit more annoying. our node modules kept conflicting and that was tough to figure out.
